# labrodev/rest-sdk
---

This repository provides a Laravel package that simplifies and standardizes communication with external REST APIs in your Laravel application. It introduces a convenient “Payload” approach, which helps you:

- **Track Requests and Endpoints:** Easily manage all the different endpoints, request payloads, and HTTP methods used when calling external APIs.
- **Improve Code Organization:** Keep your integration logic clean and maintainable by centralizing API interactions in one layer.
- **Enhance Debugging and Monitoring:** Gain better visibility into the requests made to third-party services, making it easier to diagnose issues.

With this SDK, you can wrap any external API communication under a consistent interface, ensuring your Laravel project remains flexible, readable, and easy to extend as new services are introduced.
